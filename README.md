# Weather API Project

This project fetches weather data from an API, processes it using Python, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It demonstrates data retrieval, processing, and storage workflow for a real-world API project.

## Project Structure

- weatherapi.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for fetching and processing weather data.
- your_sql_file.sql – SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting data into PostgreSQL.
- README.md – Project description and documentation.

## Features

- Fetch live weather data using a public API.
- Process and clean the data using Python (Pandas, JSON handling, etc.).
- Store the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.
- Modular code to allow future expansion, e.g., adding more APIs or automated scheduling.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
cd weather-api
